         <h2>Abuja: My favourite City</h2>

                Abuja is the capital city of Nigeria and is located right in its heart. <br>
                The city was built in the 1980’s and became Nigeria’s official capital on the 12th of December, 1991. <br>
                Although a metropolitan area, the city can be rather uninteresting and lonely sometimes. However, if you’re popping into Abuja sometime soon or perhaps you even live there, there are numerous fun places to go and exciting activities to catch up on.

                Take a boat ride at the Jabi Lake Park
                The closest thing to a beach experience in Abuja, the Jabi lake park is the perfect spot, whether you’re looking to take rides on boats, take your kids out for a fun family day or simply sit in the shade with your favourite book.<br>
                If you’re usually laid back, you can test the waters with this amazing recreational spot by embarking on your own little adventure; partake in one of the frequent dancing competitions or ride one of the well-groomed horses. <br>
